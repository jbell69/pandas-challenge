Observation from Data Sets

1) That Males represent 84% of the total 576 players.  Also 2% of the total survey group was not willing/able to state their gender (not sure why people would skip this question for this survey???)

2) That the age group of 20-24 had the largest percentage of players at 45% and this age group also spent the most money overall ($1114.06).  But the 35-39 age group spent the most money per game at a $3.60 average, possibly because this age group may make more money overall and willing to spend it on games.

3)The most popular game happened to be the most profitable but there are games that were very profitable (ex. Final Critic #4 on list) but not that popular overall (Final Critic #13 on popularity list).  This could mean that the game was interesting enough that people were willing to purchase it at a higher price so that compensated for the lack of popularity to keep profits high.
